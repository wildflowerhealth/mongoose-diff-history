# mongoose-diff-history

Stores and Manages all the differences and versions, any Mongo collection goes through it's lifecycle.

## Installation

---

### npm

```sh
npm install mongoose-diff-history
```

## Operation

---

Each update will create a history record with [jsonDiff](https://github.com/benjamine/jsondiffpatch) of the change. This helps in tracking all the changes happened to an object from the beginning.

Following will be the structure of the diff history being saved:

diff Collection schema:

```
_id : mongo id of the diff object
collectionName: Name of the collection for which diff is saved
collectionId : Mongo Id of the collection being modified
diff: diff object
user: User who modified
reason: Why the collection is modified
createdAt: When the collection is modified
_v: version
```

## Usage

---

Use as you would any Mongoose plugin:

```js
var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
    diffHistory = require('mongoose-diff-history/diffHistory'),
    schema = new mongoose.Schema({ ... });
    schema.plugin(diffHistory.plugin);
```

The plugin also has an omit option which accepts either a string or array. This will omit the given
keys from history. Follows dot syntax for deeply nested values.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const diffHistory = require('mongoose-diff-history/diffHistory');

const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
    someField: String,
    ignoredField: String,
    some: {
        deepField: String
    }
});

schema.plugin(diffHistory.plugin, { omit: ['ignoredField', 'some.deepField'] });
```

## Helper Methods

---

You can get all the histories created for an object using following method:

```js
const diffHistory = require('mongoose-diff-history/diffHistory');
const expandableFields = ['abc', 'def'];

diffHistory.getHistories('modelName', ObjectId, expandableFields, function (
    err,
    histories
) {});

// or, as a promise
diffHistory
    .getHistories('modelName', ObjectId, expandableFields)
    .then(histories => {})
    .catch(console.error);
```

If you just want the raw histories return with json diff patches:

```js
const diffHistory = require('mongoose-diff-history/diffHistory');

diffHistory.getDiffs('modelName', ObjectId, function (err, histories) {});

// or, as a promise
diffHistory
    .getDiffs('modelName', ObjectId)
    .then(histories => {})
    .catch(console.error);

// with optional query parameters:
diffHistory
    .getDiffs('modelName', ObjectId, { select: 'diff user' })
    .then(histories => {})
    .catch(console.error);
```

You can get an older version of the object using following method:

```js
const diffHistory = require('mongoose-diff-history/diffHistory');

diffHistory.getVersion(mongooseModel, ObjectId, version, function (
    err,
    oldObject
) {});

// or, as a promise
diffHistory
    .getVersion(mongooseModel, ObjectId, version)
    .then(oldObject => {})
    .catch(console.error);
```

You can also use Mongoose query options with getVersion like so:

```js
const diffHistory = require('mongoose-diff-history/diffHistory');

diffHistory.getVersion(
    mongooseModel,
    ObjectId,
    version,
    { lean: true },
    function (err, oldObject) {}
);

// or, as a promise
diffHistory
    .getVersion(mongooseModel, ObjectId, version, { lean: true })
    .then(oldObject => {})
    .catch(console.error);
```

## Example

---

I have created an [example](https://github.com/mimani/mongoose-diff-history/tree/master/example) express service (documentation [here](https://github.com/mimani/mongoose-diff-history/blob/master/example/README.md)), demonstrating this plugin via an simple employee schema, checkout `example` directory in this repo.
